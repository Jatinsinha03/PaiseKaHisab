# Money Tracker Web Application

Welcome to the **PaiseKaHisab** web application! This app is designed to help you manage your finances, track your expenses, visualize spending patterns, and provide useful financial advice. Below is a detailed overview of the app's features.

## Features

### 1. Expense Tracking

**Feature Overview:**
- **Add an Expense:** Easily record your expenses by entering the amount and selecting a category.
- **Categories:** Track your spending in predefined categories like Food, Shopping, Rent, Travel, Lend, and others.
- **Transaction History:** View a detailed history of all your transactions, including the category, date, and amount spent.

**How It Works:**
- Users enter the expense amount and select the appropriate category.
- Transactions are timestamped and stored locally, so they persist even after page reloads.
- The app maintains a complete history of transactions for future reference.

### 2. Expense Visualization

**Feature Overview:**
- **Pie Chart:** Visualize your expenses with a real-time pie chart that updates as you add new transactions.

**How It Works:**
- The pie chart reflects the percentage of spending across different categories.
- Every new expense automatically updates the chart, providing an instant visual summary.

### 3. Transaction History Table

**Feature Overview:**
- **Detailed Table:** Displays your transaction history in a clear and organized table.
- **Columns:** Includes the category, date, and amount spent for each transaction.
- **Total Spend:** Shows the total amount spent across all categories.

**How It Works:**
- The table is dynamically populated with transaction details as they are entered.
- A total at the bottom calculates the overall spending.

### 4. Financial Advice

**Feature Overview:**
- **Random Advice:** Receive random financial advice every time you visit the home page.

**How It Works:**
- Advice is fetched from the Advice Slip API and displayed on the home page.
- This feature provides quick and helpful financial tips for better money management.

### 5. GitHub Commit Count

**Feature Overview:**
- **GitHub Commit Count:** The number of commits made to build this app is dynamically fetched from GitHub.

**How It Works:**
- The app uses the GitHub API to fetch the total number of commits made to the repository and displays this count in the footer.

## Issues to be Solved

We have some tasks open for contributions. If you're a fresher or a beginner, the appâ€™s easy tech stack makes it ideal for you to start contributing! Here are some issues to work on:

1. **Hide Firebase API Keys**:
   - Currently, the Firebase API keys are publicly visible in the codebase. We need to secure these keys by hiding them properly.
   
2. **Add a Website Visitor Counter**:
   - Implement a feature to count and display the number of visitors to the website.

3. **Custom Alert Box for Input Validation**:
   - Replace the browser's default alert boxes with a custom-designed alert box for validation errors (e.g., when a user doesn't enter a value in required fields like "price" or "name"). [See the full issue details here](https://github.com/vaibhavkothari33/PaiseKaHisab/issues/4).
